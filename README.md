# Time Series Forecasting for Travel Agency
Hey there!

These are the Python files I worked on during my summer internship, where I focused on time series forecasting for Sevilla Sol Viajes, a renowned Travel Agency in Mexico. 
Each file showcases a different forecasting model, complete with comments to help you tweak the code for your own datasets.

The project involved forecasting sales through 2028. After testing multiple models, the Prophoet+XGBoost model performed the best, achieving an eror (MAPE) of around 7%. 
I also analyzed different types of sales data, like leisure trips and corporate travel, and compared the forecasts with past monthly sales.

Additionally, I used these forecasts to compare Sevilla Sol's projected growth with overall travel market growth. 
The analysis showed that Sevilla Sol is expected to grow by 7.3%, while the broader market is projected to grow by 13.97%. 
These insights, along with visualizations, were presented to management to guide strategic decision-making.
